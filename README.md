# Game Essentials

This is the custom package "Game Essentials", made to help jump-start building a project from scratch. In this package, there is:

- support for an in-code State Machine, which can be used for handling game logic outside of the Monobehaviour framework
- value objects, setters and listeners; useful for decoupled logic checks and object persistence between scenes
- event objects, useful for implementing a scene-independent event archictecture

The classes in this package are meant to be extended through inheritance and implementation of the interfaces in the project, so feel free to go past the initial scope of the package shown.
